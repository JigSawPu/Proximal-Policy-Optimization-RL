# Proximal-Policy-Optimization-RL

I've used explore-exploit to escape local minimum regions to arrive near any region that has high probability of finding global minimum. After that I used ppo policy to further refine the search region to find point which can be a global minimum. I have also attached the training data from my last successful run of the notebook. I have also added 2 notebooks to demonstrate the use of ppo to find the global min of polynomial equations
